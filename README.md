# vue-trivia

This is a test app I wrote to learn Vue.js. It is currently hosted on [Github
Pages](https://bclindner.github.io/vue-trivia/).

## Details

The app is a simple project instanced by [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) with
default babel/eslint plugins, with a plugin for
[vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) to handle some rudimentary routing. It
uses the [OpenTriviaDB](https://opentdb.com/) API to pull questions and
categories. Through it, the app allows you to configure your preferred category
(if any) and how many questions you want per round.
